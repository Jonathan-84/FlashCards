<div className="d-flex mt-auto justify-content-center">
<p> {greetingText()}I'm not an educator... I'm a dad! When my son was in Kindergarten, he entered at a different ability level, so we were often
working on extra work outside of school.
While he an his friends had focused on the building blocks of reading (letter recognition and sight words) in school, he was already practicing
 basic addition and reading at home.

His teacher would kindly send practice sheet, after practice sheet home, so I told my wife "that I could build something that does the same thing". 
With her supportive, "do it", this simple project was born.
<br></br>
    <br></br>
    The goal of this simple site was to give repeatable practice opportunities and make it fun.

<div className="d-flex mt-auto justify-content-center">
<p> {greetingText()}I'm not an educator... I'm a dad! With a young son in Kindergarten, I'm very involved with his education. 
That involvement continued when my son was interested in advancing ahead in the curriculum.
While he an his friends have focused on the building blocks of reading (letter recognition and sight words), he was already practicing
 basic addition and reading at home.

After his teacher continued to kindly send practice sheet, after practice sheet home, I announced to my wife, "that I could build something that does the same thing". 
With her supportive, "do it", this simple project was born.
<br></br>
    <br></br>
    The goal of this simple site was to give repeatable practice opportunities and make it fun.

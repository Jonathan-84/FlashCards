# üìì FlashCards üìì
## Description
I'm not an educator... I'm a dad! With a young son in Kindergarten, I'm very involved with his education. That involvement continued when my son showed a desire to cover more advanced content than his peers. While he an his friends have focused on the building blocks of reading (letter recognition and sight words), he has also been practicing basic addition at home. 
  
After his teacher continued to kindly send practice sheet, after practice sheet home, I announced to my wife, "that I could build something that does the same thing". With her supportive, "do it", this simple FlashCard project was born.

üìö Current Practice Opportunities:
+ Identify random Capital Letters
+ Identify random lower case Letters
+ Identify random numbers- Level 1 (0-20)
+ Identify random numbers- Level 2 (0-100)
+ Addition Level 1 (generate random numbers 0-10) then allow them to click the button to check their answers.
+ Addition Level 2 (generate random numbers 0-100 and add a number between 0-10) then allow them to click the button to check their answers.
+ Subtraction Level 1 (generate random numbers 0-10) then allow them to click the button to check their answers. * To keep it basic, I've set it so the difference will never be a negative number.
+ Multiplication Level 1 (generate random numbers 0-10) then allow them to click the button to check their answers.

üéÅ Motivation:
+ In basic testing, simply clicking the buttons appeared fun
+ For correct answers, they are rewarded with fun gifs  (links credited below)
+ 10 points gets a special gif
+ The tracker will not go below 0 or higher than 10

Future Development Plans:
+ Make it a Progressive Web App (may be done by the time you read this)
+ Likely will add more content to help reinforce letters (items that start with the letter)
+ Automate the grading when possible, for example Math (so you do not need to manually click tracker)
+ The content will increase, likely as my son's exposure includes (multiplication, division etc)
+ Fix bugs - currently odd behavior when going from 'Sight Words' to numbers (not on mobile, just desktop version)

## Usage
This is a web application that can be visited [here](https://jonathan-84.github.io/FlashCards/#/FlashCards/home). This application is intended for a parent to work with their children. Currently, the scoring is not automated so your kids will need to provide their answer to you, then you can adjust the tracker accordingly. For letters and numbers, they can simply tell you what the answer is. For the Sight Words, you can ask them to provide a sample sentence (I put an example on back of the card-it will appear once you click on it). Lastly is the Math, you can generate the numbers and ask them what the sum or difference is... then you can let them click the Check answer button before you update the score Tracker.

## Gifs
I want to give credit, where credit is due. Since this app is intended for children, I wanted to better control the source though and send them to a link where content could eventually change. So here they are for now: [Wicked Witch](https://www.ifitshipitshere.com/animated-halloween-gifs/), [Grogu Air](https://tenor.com/view/enjoying-the-ride-grogu-the-child-the-mandalorian-along-for-the-ride-gif-22926033), [Happy Pikachu](https://sites.google.com/site/brianclubbusiness/pikachu-happy), [Clap Haunter](https://giphy.com/gifs/pokemon-clapping-congratulations-bfMvq6ed0kfiE),  [Delighted Group](https://tenor.com/view/pokemon-pikachu-happy-delighted-yes-gif-16162693),[Happy Piplup](https://64.media.tumblr.com/13eef5b3d3c1791ccac51bc651bd6366/0c30de2d330f9a50-d6/s540x810/b48f03aeb5c2f702607b811e3b794298aef601fe.gifv),

## How You Can Contribute
I'm open to any ideas, the goal of this project is 100% about making a simple app that helps our children learn. Up to this point, I've had 2 items slow me down: the auto-scoring capability and randomizing a single sight word instead of the long list.  If you are interested in contributing with solutions to those challanges, or have other awesome ideas, please email me at jonathan.robinson@outlook.com.
